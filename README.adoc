[[versions]]
== 📌 Available Versions

This project provides multiple versions of the API. You can find the documentation for each version at the links below:

* **Version 1:** link:https://github.com/nahueltabasso/credit-card-service/blob/release-v1.0.0/README.adoc[V1.0.0]

[[description]]
== 📘 Description
This project called `Credit Card Detector & Data Extractor` is a service designed to detect **credit/debit cards** in images through YOLOv10, which is an advanced **Artificial Intelligence** technique. It also extracts data from the cards using OCR to identify card numbers, expiration dates, and cardholder names. Finally it uses a YOLOv8 classifier to classify the payment network


[[features]]
=== ☑️ Features:
* Credit/Debit card detection in images
* Extraction of card number, expiration date and cardholder name
* Support for multiple payment networks

[[notes]]
=== 📝 Notes:
This projects was developed with personal and academics goals, not for commercial purposes.
However, it is important to mention that the credit card images with I worked in this project for notebooks and demos were downloaded from Internet. So this credit cards do not belon to anybody and aren't real cards, therefore I am not using or sharing sensitive information of any person.

If you want to know how were the processes of fine-tunned of YOLO models, visit this repository link:https://github.com/nahueltabasso/yolo-fine-tunning/tree/main/docs[YOLO_FINE_TUNNING].

[[gettingstarted]]
== 🛠️ Getting Started

[[requirements]]
=== 💻 System Requirements

* Python 3.9.6 or higher
* Docker 20.10.21 or higher
* 8GB RAM minimun, 16GB recommended

You can set up the development environment for this project in two ways: using `Docker` or using a Python Virtual Environment with `pipenv` for example.

To execute this app need to declarate an environment variable to consume an extern service in a file called `.env` in the project root directory
[source,bash]
BINLIST_API_URL=https://lookup.binlist.net

Also you need to create a weights directory and download the GroundingDINO Model weights:
[source,bash]
mkdir weights
cd weights
wget -q https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
wget -q https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VxjmZVxBHcAtYlmpLu_SyohWW5UFVhEx -O YOLOv10n_CardDetector.pth
wget -q https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19lm1P0hwwR5NBo5nrE7VVJ-3bTeLHjXR -O YOLOv10n_CardElementsDetector.pth
wget -q https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xX7Qr3VzAqrkrj90DIvZNCyKC7q-Z56t -O YOLOv8n_PaymentNetworkClassifier.pth


[[docker]]
=== 🐳 Using Docker
1. Ensure you have `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system
2. Clone the repository
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/nahueltabasso/credit.git

3. Build the docker image
[source,bash]
docker-compose build

4. After built the docker image, run the container with the next command
[source,bash]
docker-compose up -d

**This will create and run a container with all necessary dependencies installed**

[[virtualenv]]
=== 🐍 Using Python Virtual Environment (pipenv)
1. Ensure you have Python and pipenv installed on your system. If you not have pipenv installed execute the next command
[source, bash]
pip install pipenv

2. Clone the repository
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/nahueltabasso/credit.git

3. Create a virtual environment and active it
[source,bash]
pipenv --python 3.9.6
pipenv shell

4. Download the requires libraries from requirements.txt
[source,bash]
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Install GroundingDINO
[source,bash]
pipenv run pip install git+https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO.git@df5b48a3efbaa64288d8d0ad09b748ac86f22671

6. Run Gradio UI to test this application
[source,bash]
python src/demo/gradio_ui.py

[[api]]
=== 🌐 Rest API Service
If you prefer you can try this service through this API, enter to this url in your browser `localhost:8000/docs`. This url will open a Swagger, that is provides by FastAPI, and can test the endpoint to detect credit cards and extract data from it.

[[apitutorial]]
==== 🐍 Using the Python API
Here's a quick example of how to use this service in your code

**Detect a credit card and Payment Network**
[source,python]
    # Load your image
    img_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
    img_np = cv2.imread(filename=img_path)
    # Detect a card in the image
    card = card_service.get_card_bbox(input_img=img_np)

**Extract data from an image**
[source, python]
    response = CreditCardData()
    if card is not None:
        # Detect the card elements
        card_elements = card_service.get_card_elements(card=card)
        # Classify the payment network
        payment_network = card_service.classify_payment_network(
            element=card_elements['payment_network'],
            card=card
        )
        response.payment_network = payment_network
        ocrService.set_img(img=card)
        ocrService.set_images(elements=card_elements)
        ocrService.set_zones_coords(zones=config.COMMON_CARD_ZONES)
        response = ocrService.extract(entity=response)
        response.obs = "Succesfull process!"
    else:
        response.obs = "Invalid image"


    print(f"PAYMENT NETWORK --- {response.type}")
    print(f"CARD NUMBER --- {response.card_number}")
    print(f"NAME --- {response.name}")
    print(f"EXPIRATION DATE --- {response.expiration_date}")

To use the REST API, send a POST request to `/api/v2/service/credit-card` endpoint with the image file:
[source,bash]
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/service/credit-card" 
-H "accept: application/json" 
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" 
-F "file=@path/to/your/image.jpg"
